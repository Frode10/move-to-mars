            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>
                Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in
                an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter bands
                are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is
                a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its moons are
                also named for mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.
            </p>
            <p>Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell,
                1,000 Earths could fit inside. It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over
                from the Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking
                about 9.9 hours to spin around once on its axis.

                    <p>Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.

                        While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.

                    <p>With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.

                        From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.

                    <p>Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes 9.9 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).

                        Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.
