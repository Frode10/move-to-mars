            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>
                Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in
                an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter bands
                are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is
                a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its moons are
                also named for mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.
            </p>
            <p>Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell,
                1,000 Earths could fit inside. It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over
                from the Sun's formation 4.6 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking
                about 9.9 hours to spin around once on its axis.

                    <p>Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're
                        looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.

                    <p>With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If
                        Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.

                        From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5
                        astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the
                        distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel
                        from the Sun to Mars.

                    <p>As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one
                        day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars
                        lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.

                        Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the
                        Sun. This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth,
                        Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes
                        longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are
                        evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons
                        vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.

                        Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols.
                        Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern
                        winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.
